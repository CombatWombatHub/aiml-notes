# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai/) is a technology that enables machines and computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It contains multiple subdivisions.
- [Machine Learning (LM)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/machine-learning/) learns from and makes decisions based on data, using algorithms to identify patterns.
- [Generative AI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/what-is-generative-ai/) creates *new* content (text, images, etc) based on what it's learned instead of just *recognizing* it.
- [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/natural-language-processing-nlp-tutorial/) understands and interacts with human languages in a way that feels natural. NLP isn't ML, though it does rely on ML. ML is the engine, NLP the application.
- [Expert Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/expert-systems/) use predefined "if-then" rules programmed by human experts to make informed decisions.
