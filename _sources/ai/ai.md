# Artificial Intelligence (AI)
[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai/) is a technology that enables machines and computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It contains multiple subdivisions.

## Categories
- [Machine Learning (ML)](./categories/ml.md) learns from and makes decisions based on data, using algorithms to identify patterns.
- [Generative AI](./categories/generative.md) creates *new* content (text, images, etc) based on what it's learned instead of just *recognizing* it.
- [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](./categories/ml.md) understands and interacts with human languages in a way that feels natural.
- [Expert Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/expert-systems/) use predefined "if-then" rules programmed by human experts to make informed decisions.

## Development
There are a lot of steps and techniques involved in creating an ML. For more information, see:
