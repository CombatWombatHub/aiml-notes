    "### Get the Dataset\n",
    "- we'll be getting the dataset from Kaggle. \n",
    "    - One problem - when you go to download a data set from a Kaggle competition, you need to agree to the competition rules, including a rule to *not* make the data available to people who haven't agreed to the competition rules. So I can't just add it to my *publicly-available* repo.\n",
    "    - I could just download it from the webpage manually and put it in the right place, but since I can't add it to tracked files, I'd need to re-do that manually for any notebooks that I'd done that for previously anytime I cloned the repo down.\n",
    "- Instead, [install the Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/blob/main/docs/README.md) to download the dataset here so I can import it into this notebook, but don't track it in Git.\n",
    "    - If you haven't already, go to the [Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching), go to the `Data` tab, and `Accept` the rules of the competition to be allowed to download the dataset.\n",
    "    - If not already installed, install the API (usually with `pip install kaggle`, but since I'm using `UV` as a dependency manager, I used `uv add kaggle`. Running `uv sync` in this repo should install with all the other dependencies)\n",
    "    - On the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/), make or login to your account, Click the Profile picture -> `Settings` -> `API` -> `Create new Token` to download `kaggle.json` to computer.\n",
    "        - Move that file to `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` (`~` is the home directory)\n",
    "        - note: I use Sphinx with `myst_nb` to turn these notebooks into documentation, and `myst_nb` runs the notebooks to check if they still work. Since I can't commit the `kaggle.json` file to the repo without making my private `kaggle api key` publicly available, specify the API key with environment variables instead: `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY`. Get those values out of the `kaggle.json` and add them to [GitHub Secrets for the Github Actions Pipeline to use](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets)\n",
    "    - run the cell below to download and unzip the dataset if it doesn't already exist. \n",
    "    - initially this gave me a `\"Forbidden URL\" error` but later it worked. Possibly I hadn't accepted the rules for the competition yet."
