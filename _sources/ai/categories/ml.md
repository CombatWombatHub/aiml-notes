# Machine Learning (ML)
[Machine Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/machine-learning/) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on *models* and [algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithms/) that let computers learn from data and improve from previous experience without being explicitly programmed. There are many [types](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/types-of-machine-learning/) of machine learning.

:::{note}
Some methods fit into multiple categories or can be adapted to be used for other categories. For the sake of brevity, these cases are not always mentioned here.

:::{note}
I'm not sure how Neural Network's, Deep Learning, AutoEncoders, DenseNets, etc. fit into these categories. They may span multiple categories, or perhaps these are more traditional ML techniques.
:::

## Categories
- **Supervised Learning** - Use labeled data.
    - **Classification** - Predict *categorical* (discrete) values.
    - **Regression** - Predict continuous numerical values.
    - **Classification|Regression** - Some models can perform either Classification or Regression.
    - **Ensemble Learning** - Combine multiple models of either type into one better model.
        - **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) Method** - Train models independently on different subsets of the data, then combine their predictions.
        - **Boosting Method** - Train models sequentially, each model focusing on errors of prior models, then do weighted combination of their predictions.
        - **Stacking (Stacked Generalization) Method** - train multiple different models (often different types), use predictions as inputs to final "meta-model".
- **Unsupervised Learning** - Use unlabeled data.
    - **Clustering** - Group data into clusters based on similarity.
        - **Centroid-Based (Partitioning) Clustering** cluster around centroids of points, choose number of clusters in advance.

- [Deep Q-Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/deep-q-learning/) - Regular **Q-Learning** is good for small problems, but struggles on complex ones (like images) since the `Q-table` gets huge and computationally expensive. **Deep Q-Learning** fixes this by using a neural network to estimate the `Q-values` instead of a `Q-table`

- [Self-Training](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/self-training-in-semi-supervised-learning/) - The model is first trained on labeled data. It then predicts labels for unlabeled data, adding high-confidence predictions to the labeled set iteratively to refine the model. Includes [Pseudo Labelling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/pseudo-labelling-semi-supervised-learning/)
- [Co-Training](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/what-is-co-training/) - Two or more models are trained on different feature subsets of the data (like one model looks at the body of an email, another looks at the subject and sender, etc). Each model labels unlabeled data for the other, enabling them to learn from complementary views.
- [Multi-View Training](https://jmlr.org/papers/v21/18-794.html) - A variation of co-training where models train on different data representations (e.g., images and text) to predict the same output.
- [Graph-Based Models (Label Propagation)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/ml-semi-supervised-learning/) - Data is represented as a graph with nodes (data points) and edges (similarities). Labels are propagated from labeled nodes to unlabeled ones based on graph connectivity.

- [Few-Shot Learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/few-shot-learning-in-machine-learning/) - a [meta-learning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/meta-learning-in-machine-learning/) process where you train the model to learn quickly from new and unseen data, so you don't have to train it with a bunch of data initially. So I guess it does some quick additional learning when you "inference" it later?
