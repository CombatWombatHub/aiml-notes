# Metrics
There are a lot of goodness of fit metrics and ways to characterize loss.

## Basics
- A model fits the data well when the differences between the **observed values** and **predicted values** are **small** and **unbiased**
- the differences between the `observed values` and `predicted values` are called `residuals`
- as the `goodness of fit` increases, the model is better fitted to the data

## Regression Metrics
- `Common Terms`
  - $y$ = observed values
  - $y_i$ = observed value $i$
  - $\hat y_i$ = predicted value $i$
  - $\bar y_i$ = average of the observed values $i$
  - $n$ = sample size
- `R-squared` (also known as **Coefficient of Determination**) is the ratio of the variance that's explained by the model to the variance that's explained by a simple mean. It's usually $0-1$, though it *can* be negative if the model is *worse* at explaining variance than just guessing the mean regardless of inputs. $R^2$ always increases as more independent variables are added, whether or not those variables are useful predictors <img src="../../images/r_squared_visualization.png" alt="Pic" width="400" />
[R2 – Score](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/python-coefficient-of-determination-r2-score/): Higher values indicate better fit ranging from 0 to 1.
  - $R^2=1-\Large\frac{RSS}{TSS}=1-\Large\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat y_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar y_i)^2}$
    - $RSS$ = **Residual Sum of Squares** = $\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat y_i)^2$
    - $TSS$ = **Total Sum of Squares** = $\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\bar y_i)^2$
- `Adjusted R-squared` is a modification of R-squared that penalizes the inclusion of variables that don't actually contribute to prediction
  - $\bar R^2=1-\Large\frac{RSS/DOF_{res}}{TSS/DOF_{tot}}$ $= 1-(1-R^2)\Large\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}$
    - $DOF_{res}$ = Degrees of Freedom of population variance around mean
    - $DOF_{tot}$ = Degrees of Freedom of population variance around model
    - $p$ = total number of explanatory variables (inputs)
- `MAE` = **Mean Absolute Error** - same scale as target variable, robust to outliers, difficult to take derivatives of due to absolute value
  - $MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n|y_i-\hat{y}_i|$
- `NMAE` = **Normalized Mean Absolute Error** - normalizes the absolute error by the range of actual values, making it a relative relative metric
  - $NMAE = \Large\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{|\hat{y}_i-y_i|}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{|y_i|}} = \frac{MAE(y,\hat{y})}{mean(|y|)}$
- `MSE` = **Mean Squared Error** - vulnerable to outliers because the error is squared
  - $MSE =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2$
- [Huber Loss](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/sklearn-different-loss-functions-in-sgd/): A hybrid loss function that transitions from `MAE` to `MSE` for larger errors, providing balance between `MAE`'s robustness and `MSE`’s sensitivity to outliers.
  - $L_\delta = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{2}(y-\hat{y})^2 &|y-\hat{y}|<\delta \\ \delta((y-\hat{y})-\frac{1}{2}\delta) & |y-\hat{y}|\ge\delta\end{cases}$
- `RMSE` = **Root Mean Squared Error** - same training results as using `MSE`, still vulnerable to outliers, compare with `MAE` to see prevalence of outliers
  - $RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}$
- `RMSLE` = **Root Mean Squared Log Error** - logs make it relative metric (ignore scale of data), less vulnerable to outliers than $RMSE$, asymmetric (larger penalty if $\hat{y}_i < y_i$ than if $\hat{y}_i > y_i$)
  - $RMSLE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\ln{(\hat{y}_i+1)} - \ln{(y_i+1)})^2} =\Large\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (\ln{\frac{\hat{y}_i+1}{y_i+1}})^2}$
  - <img src="../../images/rmse_vs_rmsle.png" alt="RMSE vs RMSLE" width="350" />
- `MAPE` = **Mean Absolute Percentage Error** (AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE) fails if any $y_i=0$, higher penalty for small $y_i$, higher penalty for $\hat{y}_i > y_i$ than $\hat{y}_i < y_i$
  - $MAPE = \Large\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{|\frac{y_i-\hat{y}_i}{y_i}|}*100$
- `SMAPE` = **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error** (AVOID) improves *somewhat* on `MAPE` but still controversial, not symmetric, and the equation itself varies by source
  - $SMAPE = \Large\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{|y_i-\hat{y}_i|}{y_i+\hat{y}_i}}$
- $BIC$ = [Bayesian Information Criterion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/bayesian-information-criterion-bic/) evaluates goodness of fit $-2\ln(L)$ while penalizing complexity to avoid overfitting $k\ln(n)$
  - $BIC = -2\ln(L) + k\ln(n)$
    - $L$ = likelihood of the model given the data
    - $k$ = number of parameters in the model
- $AIC$ = [Akaike Information Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion)
  - $AIC = 2k - 2 \ln(\hat L)$
    - $\hat L$ = maximized value of the [likelihood function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function) for the model

## Classification Metrics
- Accuracy for Classifiers is a little different, and sometimes your priority changes
  - Sometimes it's more important to catch **everything**, even if you catch some false positives
  - Sometimes it's more important that you **only** catch stuff you're sure about, and **no** false positives
- Results
  - **TP (True Positive)**:  The model `correctly`   predicted a `positive` outcome
  - **TN (True Negative)**:  The model `correctly`   predicted a `negative` outcome
  - **FP (False Positive)**: The model `incorrectly` predicted a `positive` outcome (Type I error)
  - **FN (False Negative)**: The model `incorrectly` predicted a `negative` outcome (Type II error)
- Can display with a [Confusion Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/) 
  - the link also explains the rest of these details and has example `sklearn` code to make **Confusion Matrices**
  - this one scores a model that was trying to label an image as containing a cat or an ant
  it did kind of OK (labeled one cat as an ant, but got the others correct)
  - ![ant-cat-confusion-matrix](../../images/confusion_matrix.png)
  - here's a mockup of one for a model trying to classify emails as real or spam (though without the counts)

| | Predicted as Spam | Predicted as Real |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Actually was Spam | **TP** (True Positive)  | **FN** (False Negative) |
| Actually was Real | **FP** (False Positive) | **TN** (True Negative)  |

- Metrics
  - `Accuracy` = how many predictions were correct out of the total predictions (can be misleading if one result is more dominant than another)
  - `Precision` =  how many **Positive Instances** you caught (important if you can't afford **False Positives**)
  - `Recall` = proportion of **True Positives** detected out of all **Positive Instances** (important if you can't afford **False Negatives**)
  - `F1-Score` = combines **Precision** and **Recall**, assuming **False Positives** and **False Negatives** are equally important
  - `Specificity` = how good the model is at correctly identifying **Negative Instances**
  - `Type 1 Error` = error from **False Positives**
  - `Type 2 Error` = error from **False Negatives**

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Accuracy} &= \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\
\text{Precision} &= \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\
\text{Recall} &= \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\
\text{F1 Score} &= 2 \frac{\text{Precision} * \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \\
\text{Specificity} &= \frac{TN}{TN + FP} \\
\text{Type 1 Error} &= \frac{FP}{FP + TN} \\
\text{Type 2 Error} &= \frac{FN}{TP + FN} \\
\end{align}
