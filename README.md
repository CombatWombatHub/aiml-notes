# aiml-notes

Notes and practice with a general variety of machine learning concepts and algorithms. For easy access from any location, they are converted to a GitHub Pages site with Sphinx at https://combatwombathub.github.io/aiml-notes/.

## Usage
- install prerequisites
    - [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) (I did `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` in `git bash`)
    - [install python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/#getting-started) (I did `uv python install`)
    - [install dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#running-commands) with `uv sync --all-groups` to install all dependencies (or `uv sync` to install just the ones needed to run)
- see [docs](docs/README.md) if you want to build documentation locally (it's automatically built and deployed each push)
