## Previous Repos

- I created this back when I was first taking DataCamp courses:
    - https://github.com/CombatWombatHub/Datacamp_AI_ML
- I started taking some notes on GitLab from Machine Learning Mastery courses too. There wasn't much there, so I'll just replicate or copy it.
    - https://gitlab.com/combatwombatscode/machine-learning-mastery
- it looks like I created some repos for other projects but didn't progress on them
