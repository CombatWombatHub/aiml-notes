# general-machine-learning

- Notes and practice with a general variety of machine learning concepts and algorithms

## Focus

### Goal

- become a jack-of-all trades, 
- a generalist with a lot of AI/ML disciplines
- not a laser-focused PINN specialist

### Topics

- generative
- classifiers

### Concepts

- tokenization

## Documentation

- it will be important that any notes taken here are quickly accessible from anywhere
- see the [notes created with Sphinx on GitHub Pages](https://combatwombathub.github.io/general-machine-learning/index.html)

## Usage
- install prerequisites
    - [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) (I did `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` in `git bash`)
    - [install python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/#getting-started) (I did `uv python install`)
    - [install dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#running-commands) with `uv sync --all-groups` to install all dependencies (or `uv sync` to install just the ones needed to run)
- see [docs](docs/README.md) if you want to build documentation locally (it's automatically built and deployed each push)
