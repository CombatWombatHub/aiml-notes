# Learning Pytorch
 
## Pytorch.org tutorials - Learning Pytorch with Examples
- Henry Diaz linked to this along with some other bits and discussions in #ai-factory on Slack
    - I really wish I'd gone through this earlier (also wish I'd known to go through it earlier)
    - Modulus abstracts enough that it lets you get spinning without really understanding Pytorch or its Tensors
    - that was enough, until now at least. I'll build a simple model to test my gradient-in-the-loss theory

## Basics
- Pytorch provides two core features
    - an n-dimensional Tensor, similar to numpy, but can be run on GPU's
    - auotmatic differentiation for building and training neural networks
 
## Without Pytorch: Numpy Network
- inputs are an array of 2000 training points
    - $x = -{\pi\over2},-{\pi\over2}+{\pi\over2000},-{\pi\over2}+{2\pi\over2000},\cdots,{\pi\over2}$
- actual function we're trying to fit (y becomes array of 2000 true points) (calculate once)
    - $y=sin(x)$
- each round they do this, calculating an estimate and loss, gradients, updating the weights
    - try to fit with a polynomial with randomly initialized weights $a,b,c,d$ ($y_{pred}$ becomes an array of 2000 predicted points)
        - $y_{pred}=a+b*x+c*x^2+d*x^3$
    - calculate the Loss of each step by summing the error up from each of the 2000 $y_{pred}$ points each step (Loss)
        - $L_{point}=(y_{pred}-y)^2$
        - $L_{step}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{2000}(y_{pred}-y)^2$
    - will use the chain rule to calculate gradient of the Loss with respect to each weight
        - $\displaystyle{\begin{aligned} {\partial L_{step}\over\partial a} &=\sum{\partial L_{point}\over\partial a} \\ {\partial L_{point}\over\partial a}  &= {\partial L_{point}\over\partial y_{pred}} {\partial y_{pred}\over\partial a} \\ {\partial L_{point}\over\partial y_{pred}} &=2(y_{pred}-y) \\ \end{aligned}}$
    - calculate gradient of Loss with respect to each weight
        - $\displaystyle\begin{aligned} {\partial y_{pred}\over\partial a} & =1   &\to {\partial L_{point}\over\partial a} & =2(y_{pred}-y) 1   &\to {\partial L_{step}\over\partial a} & =\sum 2(y_{pred}-y) 1   \\ {\partial y_{pred}\over\partial b} & =x   &\to {\partial L_{point}\over\partial b} & =2(y_{pred}-y) x   &\to {\partial L_{step}\over\partial b} & =\sum 2(y_{pred}-y) x   \\ {\partial y_{pred}\over\partial c} & =x^2 &\to {\partial L_{point}\over\partial c} & =2(y_{pred}-y) x^2 &\to {\partial L_{step}\over\partial c} & =\sum 2(y_{pred}-y) x^2 \\ {\partial y_{pred}\over\partial d} & =x^3 &\to {\partial L_{point}\over\partial d} & =2(y_{pred}-y) x^3 &\to {\partial L_{step}\over\partial d} & =\sum 2(y_{pred}-y) x^3 \\ \end{aligned}$
    - calculate each of these for 2000 points for 2000 steps, updating the model weights each step
        - calculate gradient with respect to each weight
        - update the weights
        - it got the error down decently well
 
### Negative Gradients
- note that whenever a gradient is applied it looks like
    - `a -= learning_rate * grad_a`
- this is because we are trying to *minimize* loss
- and the gradient is the direction to go to most swiftly *increase* the loss
- since gradient is the direction of *greatest increase*
- so in order to minimize, we move *opposite the direction of greatest increase*
- i.e. negative gradient, the exact opposite of the gradient direction
 
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import numpy as np
import math
 
# Create random input and output data
x = np.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000)
y = np.sin(x)
 
# Randomly initialize weights
a = np.random.randn()
b = np.random.randn()
c = np.random.randn()
d = np.random.randn()
 
# multiply by the gradient to determine how much to update them each round
learning_rate = 1e-6
 
# train for 2000 rounds. 't'
for t in range(2000):
    # Forward pass: compute predicted y
    # y = a + b x + c x^2 + d x^3
    y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3
 
    # Compute loss by squaring the difference between the prediction and the true value
    # didn't divide it by the number of points either
    loss = np.square(y_pred - y).sum()
 
    #print the loss at 99 steps and every 100 after that
    if t % 100 == 99:
        print("step:", t,"loss:", loss)
 
    # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss
 
    # multiply the error between prediction and true by 2. Will be an array of 2000 errors
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    # calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight and sum up into one value
    grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()
    grad_b = (grad_y_pred * x).sum()
    grad_c = (grad_y_pred * x ** 2).sum()
    grad_d = (grad_y_pred * x ** 3).sum()
 
    # Update weights, subtracting the gradient multiplied by the learning rate
    a -= learning_rate * grad_a # NOTE - gradient is the direction of greatest increase to a function
    b -= learning_rate * grad_b # we want to decrease the function (loss)
    c -= learning_rate * grad_c # so we subtract our gradients
    d -= learning_rate * grad_d
 
print(f'Result: y = {a} + {b} x + {c} x^2 + {d} x^3')
```
 
## Adding Pytorch: Tensors
- Numpy is cool, but can't use GPU to accelerate calculations (which would be like 50X faster or more)
    - Use Pytorch Tensors - it's like a numpy array but it can keep track of the computational graph and gradients
    - can also use GPU's - you just need to specify the device
- do basically the same thing as before
    - but use stuff like `torch.linspace` instead of `np.linspace`
    - and assign them to the device to solve on
- PyTorch must be keeping a record of what Tensors are on what device, how they're calculated, etc
    - it will let the GPU do the calculations without having to send instructions to it every step
    - the record of what's where and how's calculated is the the computational graph?
- must define the forward and backward steps here as well
 
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 
import torch
import math
 
dtype = torch.float # set the datatype for the new Tensors to store to be torch floats
device = torch.device("cpu") # set to use the cpu
# device = torch.device("cuda:0") # Uncomment this to run on GPU
 
# Create random input and output data
x = torch.linspace(-math.pi, math.pi, 2000, device=device, dtype=dtype) # <- create the 2000
y = torch.sin(x) # <- define the 2000 true points in the established range
 
# Randomly initialize weights and put the tensor on the device
a = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
b = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
c = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
d = torch.randn((), device=device, dtype=dtype)
 
learning_rate = 1e-6
for t in range(2000):
   
    ################
    # Forward pass # compute prediction
    ################ compute loss
 
    # compute predicted y
    y_pred = a + b * x + c * x ** 2 + d * x ** 3
 
    # Compute and print loss
    loss = (y_pred - y).pow(2).sum().item()
    if t % 100 == 99:
        print(t, loss)
 
    ##################
    # Backwards Pass # calculate gradients
    ################## update weights
 
    # Backprop to compute gradients of a, b, c, d with respect to loss
    grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)
    grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()
    grad_b = (grad_y_pred * x).sum()
    grad_c = (grad_y_pred * x ** 2).sum()
    grad_d = (grad_y_pred * x ** 3).sum()
 
    # Update weights using gradient descent
    a -= learning_rate * grad_a
    b -= learning_rate * grad_b
    c -= learning_rate * grad_c
    d -= learning_rate * grad_d
 
print(f'Result: y = {a.item()} + {b.item()} x + {c.item()} x^2 + {d.item()} x^3')
print(f'Final Loss: {loss}')
```
 
## Autograd
- now we get into the real special capabilities of Torch
    - we had to define forward and backward passes manually up above
    - that's ok for such a tiny 'network' of four weights, but would scale up drastically
    - luckily, Torch is capable of automatic differentiation, bypassing the symbolic by-hand differentiation that I, a human, needed to do
- AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION [(Wiki Link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)
    - <img src="../../images/auto_differentiation_nutshell.png" height ="150">
    - uses the chain rule, taking derivative of each little operation ("accumulating" derivatives)
        - say we have a function of other functions
            - $y=f(g(h(x)))$
        - to evaluate it, we would
            - feed in some $x$-value (call it $w_0$),
            - evaluate the innermost function to get $w_1=h(w_{0})$,
            - then evaluate the next innermost function and so on until we got to the outside
                - ${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned} y&=f(g(h(x))) & \gets && x & =w_{0}\\ &=f(g(h(w_{0})))& \gets && h(w_{0}) & =w_{1}\\ &=f(g(w_{1})) & \gets && g(w_{1}) & =w_{2}\\ &=f(w_{2}) & \gets && f(w_{2}) & =w_{3}\\ &=w_{3} \end{aligned}}}$
            - so now we've got four values, one for each of the component functions in the chain
                - ${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned} y= && w_{3} & =f(w_{2}) \\ && w_{2} & =g(w_{1}) \\ && w_{1} & =h(w_{0}) \\ && w_{0} & =x \end{aligned}}}$
        - if we wanted the gradient of $y$ with respect to $x$, we would use the chain rule
            - ${\displaystyle {\frac {\partial y}{\partial x}}={\frac {\partial f(w_{2})}{\partial w_{2}}}{\frac {\partial g(w_{1})}{\partial w_{1}}}{\frac {\partial h(w_{0})}{\partial x}}={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{2}}}{\frac {\partial w_{2}}{\partial w_{1}}}{\frac {\partial w_{1}}{\partial x}}}$
    - can be done forwards or backwards. backpropogation is a special case of reverse accumulation
        - forwards (tangent mode) traverses the chain rule from the inside out starting with $\displaystyle{\frac {\partial w_{1}}{\partial x}}$
            - $\to$ more efficient if more outputs than inputs?
            - hold the output constant and differentiate backwards with
        - backwards (adjoint mode) traverses the chain rule from the outside in starting with $\displaystyle{\frac {\partial f(w_{2})}{\partial w_{2}}}$
            - $\to$ more efficient if more inputs than outputs?
    - backwards is more efficient for the setup we have with machine learning (often network has a single output and many inputs)
        - great for a neural network that converges down into few outputs since you start with output, find the derivative, and branch it backwards
        - basically you get to calculate a partial derivative once and reuse it a bunch of times, which is great if there are fewer outputs than inputs
        - <img src="../../images/reverse_accumulation.png" height ="200">
        - for forward propogation the inputs are you basically need to evaluate the gradients once for each independent variable (input)
        - for forward propogation you basically need to evaluate the gradients once for each independent variable (input)
    - Reverse Accumulation by hand - you substitute the derivative of the outermost function with a new chain rule repeatedly
        - ${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial y}{\partial x}}&={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{1}}}{\frac {\partial w_{1}}{\partial x}}\\&=\left({\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{2}}}{\frac {\partial w_{2}}{\partial w_{1}}}\right){\frac {\partial w_{1}}{\partial x}}\\&=\left(\left({\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{3}}}{\frac {\partial w_{3}}{\partial w_{2}}}\right){\frac {\partial w_{2}}{\partial w_{1}}}\right){\frac {\partial w_{1}}{\partial x}}\\&=\cdots \end{aligned}}}$
    - Reverse accumulation by The **adjoint** ${\bar {w}}_{i}$ - the derivative of a chosen dependent variable with respect to a *subexpression* $w_{i}$
        - ${\displaystyle {\bar {w}}_{i}={\frac {\partial y}{\partial w_{i}}}}$
    - If $w_i$ has successors in the computational graph, use the chain rule:
        - ${\displaystyle {\bar {w}}_{i}=\sum _{j\in \{{\text{successors of i}}\}}{\bar {w}}_{j}{\frac {\partial w_{j}}{\partial w_{i}}}}$
        - I believe that this is what's accounting for nodes ahead of the current one being affected by its changes
        - you have to sum up the effect it has on all of the nodes it feeds into
        - and the activation of a node feeds into all the nodes ahead of it in a fully-connected network
        - and then since all of those nodes feed into all of the nodes ahead of them...
        - well, you do already have all of those partial derivatives from doing the layers in front of the current one
        - but that's a lot of numbers getting multiplied together
    - note that there is additional overhead for reverse propogation
        - you need to store those partial derivative values

## PyTorch: Tensors and Autograd
- provides the funcionality from above
- **Forward Pass** of the network
    - defines the **computational graph**
        - nodes in the graph will be Tensors
            - if `x` is a Tensor that has the setting `x.requires_grad=True`
            - then `x.grad` will be another Tensor that will hold the gradient of `x` with respect to some scalar value
        - edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors
            - are edges weights and biases?
            - or is an edge like $a=\sigma(w\cdot a+b)$?
- **Backwards Propogation**
    - backpropogate through the graph
        - computes gradients
- previously we had to manually create the gradients for the backwards pass with
    - `grad_y_pred = 2.0 * (y_pred - y)` and `grad_a = grad_y_pred.sum()` etc
- this time, we'll just use `loss.backward()`
    - no need to manually implement the gradients this time
- since `loss` was established as a function of $y_{pred}$ which is a function of the weights `a,b,c,d`
    - and because Pytorch will keep track of how it got to its final function?
    - since it creates a computational graph to get there and keeps it on hand?
    - the computational graph being composed of node `Tensors` and function `Edges`?
    - so it's easy to work backwards and find the gradients?

## latex formulas in docstrings
-  the docstring in  https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/torch/nn/utils/parametrizations.py
- for def weight_norm includes this:
- $\mathbf{w} = g \dfrac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}$
- which turns into this formula
- $\mathbf{w} = g \dfrac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}$
- so it must be possible to put latex formulas in docstrings
 
## Defining new Autograd functions
- each Autograd operator is basically just two functions that operate on Tensors
    - `forward`
        - computes output Tensors from input Tensors
        - necessary as the activations of each node and such are plugged in to the chain rule functions
    - `backward`
        - receives the gradient of the output Tensors with respect to some scalar value (from the custom autograd?)
        - computes the gradient of the input Tensors with respect to that same scalar value (using the custom autograd?)
- can define our own autograd function by:
    - define a subclass of `torch.autograd.Function`
    - implement `forward` and `backward` functions
- then use it by:
    - construct instance of the new autograd operator
    - and call it like a function, passing in input Tensors
- example:
    - define new model using a [Legendre Polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials) instead of $y_{pred}=a+b*x+c*x^2+d*x^3$
        - 3rd-degree Legendre Polynomial (the red one) looks like a sine wave

## Pytorch's `nn` module
- For big neural networks, raw autograd can be a bit too low-level
    - we are usually building the computation into **layers**, some of which have **learnable parameters** to optimize
- Pytorch uses the `nn` module to provide high level abstractions over raw computational graphs
    - this is the equivalent `TensorFlow` packages like of `Keras`, `TensorFlow-Slim`, and `TFLearn`
- The `nn` package
    - defines a set of **modules**
        - roughly equivalent to neural network layers
        - receives input Tensors, computes output Tensors
        - may also hold internal state such as Tensors containing learnable parameters
        - defines a set of useful loss functions
- example
    - using the `nn` package to implement our polynomial model network
 
### Zeroing Gradients
- we always seem to need to zero the gradients after we apply them
- that was true for both the manual method and this `nn` method
- I wonder if it just sums them up otherwise
 
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

print("x tensor of inputs x, shape:", x.shape, "contents:\n",x)
y = torch.sin(x)
print("y tensor of true outputs y, shape:", y.shape, "contents:\n",y)
 
# For this example, the output y is a linear function of (x, x^2, x^3), so
# we can consider it as a linear layer neural network. Let's prepare the
# tensor of (x, x^2, x^3) values
p = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
print("p tensor of powers (x,x^2,x^3), shape:", p.shape, "contents:\n",p)
# unsqeeze(-1) adds a new dimension after the last index, so it adds 1 after (2000) to get (2000,1)
# use x.unsqueeze(-1) to convert the x tensor of shape (2000) with 2000 linearly-spaced x-values
# Raise it to the power of the p-tensor [1, 2, 3] of shape (3,1)
# this will broadcast the shape of x.unsqueeze(-1) from (2000,1) to (2000,3)
# (basically copying the column over three times)
# then raise each element to the appropriate power from the same column of p
xx = x.unsqueeze(-1).pow(p)
print("xx tensor of x,x^2,x^3-values, shape:", xx.shape, "contents:\n",xx)
# In the above code, x.unsqueeze(-1) has shape (2000, 1), and p has shape
# (3,), for this case, broadcasting semantics will apply to obtain a tensor
# of shape (2000, 3)
 
# Use the nn package to define our model as a sequence of layers. nn.Sequential
# is a Module which contains other Modules, and applies them in sequence to
# produce its output. The Linear Module computes output from input using a
# linear function, and holds internal Tensors for its weight and bias.
# The Flatten layer flattens the output of the linear layer to a 1D tensor,
# to match the shape of `y`
model = torch.nn.Sequential( # create Sequential nn Module containing other nn Modules
    # add a Linear nn Module
    # This will take the input Tensor (we will give it the (2000,3) Tensor with columns of [x, x^2, x^3] values)
    # and produce an output Tensor of (2000,1) y_pred=a1 x + a2 x^2 + a3 x^3 + b values
    # Linear will automatically incorporate the weights and biases (it defaults to bias=True)
    # Linear will apply a linear transformation of y = xA^T + b to the incoming data
    # A^T is the (3,1) transpose of the (1,3) weights Tensor containing the weights for x^1, x^2, x^3
    # b is the bias Tensor, it only contains 1 element
    # so xA^T -> (2000,3)(3,1) -> (2000,1) <- it is multiplying a1 by each x entry, a2 by each x^2 entry, etc and then adding the columns up
    #    xA^T + b -> (2000,1) + (1) = (2000,1) <- adding a scalar to a Tensor should just add it element by element
    # so its outputting a (2000,1) Tensor of y_pred values, one y_pred per each of the 2000 input x samples

## PyTorch's Optim Package
- we've been manually updating the weights so far. Each time, we've:
    - run through the entire training data set,
    - found the Loss for the entire training data set by summing up the squared error from each x-point
    - done backprop to get the gradient of the Loss with respect to each of the learnable parameters
    - applied `torch.no_grad()` to manually manipulate the learnable parameters by
    - multiplying the current value of the learnable parameters by that gradient and the learning rate
    - looped back around and did it all again 2000 times
- Optimizers
    - that was ok for a simple optimization like stochastic gradient descent
    - but in practice we'll want to use more sophisticated optimizers like `AdaGrad`, `RMSProp`, or `Adam`
    - the `optim` package can perform those
- Compactness
    - wow, this code is getting way more compact
    - if I removed all of the comments it would be downright slim
 
### optimizer.zero_grad() and WHY WE ZERO GRADIENTS
- FINALLY they explain why we always zero out the gradients
    - by default, gradients are not overwritten, they are saved to buffers
    - so if I *didn't* zero them out, we would be accumulating more and more stored gradients every training step
    - and those bois can get *big*
    - and since I'm using Jupyter, I'll bet I would have just accumulated more and more every time I hit run until the kernel crashed
- summing up gradients
    - in the 3blue1brown video,
    - it was mentioned that you do your backpropogation to get a list of gradients for each training input in a batch
    - then you sum those up
    - so the purpose of it defaulting to keeping them around is probably so that you can sum up the gradients for a batch
    - and use that to get your final gradient values that actually get applied to update your weights
    - and it doesn't just sum them up as it goes since you may want to do something more complicated
    - I mean Neural Tangent Kernel and other methods would probably want to hold back some specific gradients etc
    - so it saves the gradient 'suggestions' for each training case, combines them for the batch (somehow)
    - and then you call `optimizer.step()`, which has procedures or optimization and has been given both your model and the learning rate
    - and that uses those sets of gradients to figure out how to update

## Custom `nn` Modules
- can subclass `nn.Module` to create custom modules
- define a `forward` which receives input Tensors and produces output Tensors using other modules or autograd operations on Tensors
- example: implement that 3rd order polynomial from earlier as a custom Module subclass
- looks like we don't need to define a custom `backward` procedure this time

## Control Flow and Weight Sharing
- dynamic network
    - you can change up the size and shape of the network from step to step
- we're going to make a wierd model now
    - a 3rd-order polynomial
        - $y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3$
    - on each foward pass, it will choose a random number from 4,5,6
        - it will use that many orders, sharing a weight for them
    - The final equation could be any of these
        - $y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4$
        - $y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + ex^5$
        - $y = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ex^4 + ex^5 + ex^6$
- use Python flow control to implement the loop
    - implement weight sharing by resuing the same parameters multiple times when defining the forward pass

# PyTorch Pth Files
 
# PTH files and using a trained model
- assembled from sources such as this medium [article](https://medium.com/@yulin_li/what-exactly-is-the-pth-file-9a487044a36b)
 
## What is a PTH file
- machine learning model created with PyTorch
- contains algorithms to automatically perform a task
    - upscaling/identifying an image etc
- saved using `torch.save(model, PATH)` etc
    - `torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")`
 
## What's in it?
- a serialized PyTorch state dictionary
- Python dictionary containing the state of a PyTorch model
    - **the weights, biases, and other parameters**
- serialized means it's converted into a format to be easily saved to a disk and reconstructed
    - converted into a sequence of bytes (smaller and more compact than the original data structure)
    - the Python pickle module is what serializes it
 
## How to Use
- PTH files are not meant to be opened
- they are meant to be integrated or imported into an application
- where they can be trained further or used to perform a task
- `model = torch.load(PATH)`
- `model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))`
    - uses `torch.load()` function to load the state dictionary from the `model.pth` file
    - uses `load_state_dict()` method to load the state dictionary into the `model` model
- I guess once you've loaded it into the `model`, you can submit a set of inputs to `model` somehow and get out a prediction
