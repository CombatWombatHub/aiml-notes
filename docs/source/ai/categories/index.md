[**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai/) is a technology that enables machines and computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It contains multiple subdivisions.

- **Machine Learning (ML)** learns from and makes decisions based on data, using algorithms to identify patterns.
- **Generative AI** creates *new* content (text, images, etc) based on what it's learned instead of just *recognizing* it.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** understands and interacts with human languages in a way that feels natural.
- [**Expert Systems**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/expert-systems/) use predefined "if-then" rules programmed by human experts to make informed decisions.
